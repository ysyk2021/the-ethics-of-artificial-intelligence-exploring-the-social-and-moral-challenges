Definition and Overview of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
=====================================================================

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly evolving field that involves developing systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence, such as perception, language understanding, decision-making, and problem-solving. These systems are designed to learn from data, adapt to new situations, and improve their performance over time.

The term "artificial intelligence" was first coined in the 1950s, and since then, the field has grown to encompass a wide range of technologies and applications. Some common examples of AI systems include virtual assistants, chatbots, image recognition tools, and self-driving cars.

AI can be classified into two main categories: narrow or weak AI, and general or strong AI. Narrow AI refers to systems that are designed to perform specific tasks within a limited domain, such as playing chess or analyzing medical images. General AI, on the other hand, would be capable of performing any intellectual task that a human can do.

While the development of AI has the potential to revolutionize industries and improve our daily lives, it also raises important ethical questions related to autonomy, responsibility, transparency, and bias. As AI becomes increasingly sophisticated and integrated into our daily lives, it is essential to consider these ethical implications and develop frameworks for responsible development and deployment.

This book will explore the social and moral challenges posed by intelligent technologies, examining the impact of AI on society and its implications for ethics. Through thoughtful analysis and discussion, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the ethical debates surrounding AI and offer insights into how we can ensure that these technologies are developed and deployed in a responsible and beneficial manner.
